# CIBERER/GdTBioinfo-nf-mosaicism: Documentation

The CIBERER/GdTBioinfo-nf-mosaicism documentation is split into the following pages:

- [Usage](usage.md)
  - An overview of how the pipeline works, how to run it and a description of all of the different command-line flags.
- [Output](output.md)
  - An overview of the different results produced by the pipeline and how to interpret them.

You can find a lot more documentation about installing, configuring and running nf-core pipelines on the website: [https://nf-co.re](https://nf-co.re)

This pipeline uses code and infrastructure developed and maintained by the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) community, reused here under the [MIT license](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/master/LICENSE).
